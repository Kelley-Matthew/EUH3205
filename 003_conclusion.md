# Conclusion

As Europe progressed from the early industrial era to what we now consider modernity, the development of key technological innovations had a great impact on contemporary politics and society. Many inventions were first developed in the 19th century, such as photography and the automobile. Other technologies, such as the modern sewer system, were the result of a continued chain of scientific discoveries and research going back thousands of years. Altogether, 19th-century technologies would bring modern urban society to fruition. Advancement in agriculture allowed the mass production of crops, therefore permitting the mass migration of Europeans into urban centers. The chemicals needed for modern agriculture were made in urban factories, which contributed to European urbanization. 19th-century European technology would affect not only the day-to-day lives of the citizenry but also the ever-changing state of global politics on a macro level. Inventions such as the steam engine would expand military capabilities around the world, contributing to a new era of warfare. 
European technologies of the 19th century have delivered us into the world we know today. From the photograph, to the warship, European scientific advancement of this era has since guided the flow of history.
