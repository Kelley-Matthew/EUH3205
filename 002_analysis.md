# Analysis 1 - Major Developments in 19th-Century Technology by Maya Frazier

## The Camera
In 1822, Joseph Nicephore Niepce, a French inventor,  developed the process of heliography, the first attempt at photography. Niepce used pewter plates and a camera obscura, a man made projector, to light-etch images onto the plates.[^1] The exposure time was several days, and produced a blurry image. The first heliograph was destroyed during attempts to copy it, and the older images did not survive for long. However, the oldest surviving heliograph we have today is from 1827.[^2] Niepce passed away in 1833, but the work around photography continued. Louis Daguerre, Niepce’s work partner, created a more practical process using mercury vapors and silver iodide treated plates. He, in collaboration with Niepce’s son Isidore, invented the daguerreotype, an early camera that was able to provide images with much shorter exposure times.[^3] This technology was purchased by the French government and declared a free patent, spreading the ideas and making it accessible for anyone to use.[^4]
	Within the 1850s, mobile photography studios became popular, due to photos needing to be developed from negatives to see the proper image. People would pose for about 3 minutes while the photo was taken, a drastic difference from the hours needed to create an image just a few years earlier. Neck braces and supportive chairs were commonly used to prop people up during the time they had to sit still.
	In 1888, Kodak cameras went on sale with film rolls.[^5] People could now take their own photos without relying on a photographer, a tripod or complicated developing processes. People could take the photos and send the film back to the Kodak factory for developing. And, at the turn of the century, in 1900, the Kodak Brownie was released; a handheld, personal camera that would be transported anywhere. 
	The invention and improvement of photography is important because it marks the beginning of photographic history. We can track people, events, inventions, places and artifacts though actual images of them, instead of relying on second hand accounts of them. This technology expanded history, and allows anyone from the future to physically see events from the past.

## The Automobile
While the definitive inventor of the automobile is widely contested, Karl Benz in Germany was the first to create a marketable self-propelled vehicle. On January 29, 1886, he applied for a patent for a vehicle powered by a gas engine.[^6] In the early images of automobiles we can see how they are a far cry from the vehicles we are used to today. In fact, the engine output was less than one horsepower, had a top speed of 10 mph, and featured three wheels.[^7]
The car, named the Patent-Motorwagen, took its maiden voyage on July 3, 1886 on the Ringstrasse, a small stretch of road in Mannheim, Germany. However, it was in 1888, two years later, when the car gained fame. Bertha Benz, Karl’s wife, drove the car from Mannheim to  her mother’s house in Pforzheim, about 66 miles, showing the car’s practical use over long distances.[^8] In the following year, it was shown at the 1889 Paris Exposition. 25 Patent-Motorwagens were created from 1886-1894.
  From here, the industry grew, and automobiles were seen in both Europe and America at the turn of the century. Karl Benz merged his company with Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach, creating the Daimler-Benz company. This is now known today as the Mercedes Benz car brand, named after a popular model produced following the Patent-Motorwagen. Ransom E. Olds founded the company Oldsmobile, and produced thousands of cars through the use of the assembly line in the early 20th century.  
The invention of automobiles is significant because it allowed people and products to travel further, faster, and more efficiently. This ushered in a shift from horse-drawn carriages to machine powered transportation across Europe and the United States, making everyone’s lives more connected.

## The Sewer System
Another type of technology invented was the sewer system, and was developed in England. 19th century London sewage disposal was known as ‘cesspits’.[^9] Household waste was collected in perforated buckets and disposed of weekly, either taken to farms or dumped in the Thames. Worker men would come during the night and collect the solid waste to minimize concern about the smell. Once at the farms, the waste would be used as fertilizer on crops. Or, if it was dumped in the Thames, it would often wash back towards the city due to the tidal nature of the river. However, due to the overwhelming number of people within the city, it was impossible for collectors to perform their jobs fully. So, London began to reek with the smell of sewage.
Due to the ineffective disposal, human waste began causing health problems. In 1831, London suffered its first cholera epidemic due to the direct contact with fecal matter and the illness spreading waterborne through the Thames. The city suffered two more epidemics in 1848 and 1853, claiming thousands of lives.[^10]
In 1858, London experienced ‘The Great Stink’, which was caused by the unusual heat during the summer impacting the already-present waste in the Thames, combined with the industrial runoff and fumes.[^11] The smell was omnipresent, and covered every inch of the city with a foul odor. Politicians could no longer ignore the issue of waste disposal, so they hired Joseph Bazalgette to solve the issue. 
In 1859, a large-scale sewage system began construction in England.[^12] Bazalgette, a long time advocate for a comprehensive sewer system designed the underground system. These pipes drew the waste away from the city, and disposed of it into the Thames far enough where it could be taken out to the sea. This lowered infectious diseases, health hazards, and the smell.
 This technology is significant because it marked a new interest in public health, sanitation, and hygiene. The government took responsibility for the public health of the people by recognizing the problem, passing legislation to address it, and engineering a solution.

# Analysis 2 - Social & Demographic Impact of Technology in 19th century Europe by Liya Johny
The second analysis will explore how developments in transportation, chemical manufacturing, and agricultural productivity collectively enhanced the social and demographic characteristics of 19th-century Europe, primarily through urbanization and shifting population distributions across European societies.


The development of railroads considerably altered social mobility and urbanization in 19th-century Europe. Rail networks expanded, facilitating faster movement of goods and people across vast distances. For instance, the London & Birmingham Railway significantly altered population dynamics in England.[^13] Reducing travel time between urban centers facilitated the movement of laborers and their families seeking employment in flourishing industries, particularly in Birmingham's manufacturing sectors and London’s growing service economy. Rural populations were drawn to urban centers along the railway route, leading to a more concentrated urban population. Moreover, railway systems contributed to the rapid urbanization of areas along its route, with towns such as Watford[^14] and Rugby, previously smaller settlements, expanding as railway stations became focal points for trade and commerce. In Germany, the length of railroad tracks quadrupled between 1850 and 1873. By 1870, railways had become Germany's largest employer, with the workforce growing tenfold in the span of two decades. Indicators of this growth were evident: the permanent German railway labor force rose from 26,084 workers in 1850 to 234,114 by 1870, while the Prussian net domestic product surged from 28.9 to 365.5 during the same period.[^15] The development of railroads was a catalyst for urbanization because it provided efficient transportation of goods and people, which in turn stimulated commerce, industrial production, and population growth. Rural workers, attracted by the promise of steady work and better living conditions, moved closer to industrial hubs, allowing cities like Berlin, Leipzig, and Hamburg to experience significant urbanization. Already a political and cultural center, Berlin grew into a central industrial point as railways connected it to raw materials, markets, and labor.

Additionally, Breakthroughs in chemical manufacturing, including the creation of synthetic dyes, fertilizers, and explosives, had profound social and demographic consequences. German chemist Justus von Liebig laid the groundwork for understanding soil nutrients in the mid-19th century, and the later advancements made by Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch in 1909 with the synthesis of ammonia[^16] were crucial in revolutionizing European agricultural practices. Liebig’s work established the foundation for using nitrates and phosphates, which significantly boosted soil fertility, while Haber and Bosch’s synthesis of ammonia enabled the mass production of nitrogen-based fertilizers. For instance, the discovery and import of Peruvian guano[^17] in England and later synthetic nitrogen fertilizers alleviated food shortages, helping to sustain growing urban populations in rapidly industrializing cities like Berlin and Hamburg. The expansion of Germany’s chemical industry created a higher demand for factory labor, particularly in cities like Ludwigshafen, where BASF, one of the world's largest chemical companies, was founded. The production of synthetic dyes, such as mauveine and other aniline dyes, became a booming industry for textile manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.[^18] Factories producing these dyes employed thousands, thus continuing migration patterns of drawing laborers from rural areas into cities. However, although chemical manufacturing brought about economic growth and development across Europe, it also introduced severe environmental and health risks. Factories producing dyes and explosives often discharged toxic waste into rivers, such as the Rhine, leading to widespread water pollution. In Ludwigshafen, industrial smog and chemical fumes were persistent problems, contributing to respiratory illnesses among the working-class population.

Furthermore, technological advancements in agriculture, such as mechanized farming equipment and improved crop rotation methods, enhanced food production and allowed for larger, more efficient farms. European nations produced more food with less labor, thus supporting larger populations and accelerating urbanization by pushing rural workers to seek employment in growing industrial centers. For example, as agricultural technology advanced during the mid-19th century, the proportion of males engaged in agricultural occupations fell significantly, declining from 27% in 1851 to 19% in 1871.[^19] This shift reflects the growing mechanization of farming, which reduced the demand for manual labor in rural areas. Many male workers migrated to industrial cities in search of factory jobs, drawn by the higher wages and opportunities in sectors like manufacturing and transportation. This trend highlights a major demographic transition of the era, as labor patterns shifted from agrarian to industrial economies, permitting rapid urbanization and reshaping societal structures. These workers now gravitated towards industrial hubs like Manchester and Birmingham[^20] in Britain, Berlin in Germany, and Lyon in France, contributing to the rapid urbanization and factory workforce in those cities. The agricultural surplus produced during this period helped stabilize food supplies in cities, supporting population growth and reducing the frequency of famines. Notably, the more prevalent usage of chemical fertilizers significantly influenced agricultural productivity in 19th-century Europe. Farmers increasingly relied on nitrates, potassium, and phosphates produced by the booming chemical industries in countries like Germany and Britain. These fertilizers were vital to maintaining nutrients in the soil, thus enabling higher crop yields and more reliable harvests. However, beyond the agricultural sector, technological progress in the steel industry[^21] also became advantageous for food supplies. Mechanized steel farming equipment, such as plows and reapers, allowed farmers to cultivate larger areas and harvest crops more efficiently, thus enhancing agricultural productivity, reducing the reliance on manual labor, and supporting growing urban populations. Simultaneously, steel was essential in building railroads, which created a transportation network that connected rural farming regions to urban markets and ports. These expansive railroad systems ensured fresh produce, grains, and raw materials could reach populations quickly and with minimal spoilage, further stabilizing food supplies and enabling trade.

# Analysis 3 - Political Impact of Technology in 19th century Europe by Mary Cofran
Industrialization in Europe influenced different aspects of the nation, including the military and political spheres. The development of the steamship and steam engine was an integral part of military progress and the impact on political focus. In 1845, the first Royal Navy ships were powered by a steam engine. Not only did the steam engine impact the military, but it also changed the game for mass production and consumerism. The steam engine allowed for more productive travel, leading to a growth in overseas markets and more room for market expansion. In 1881, the first ship powered by a triple-expansion steam engine, showing the rapid advancement of the technology arising in the Industrialization period. With the introduction of a new way of commercializing markets and mobilizing the military, Europe, most specifically Britain, was able to construct a new meaning for industrialization in political, economic, and military realms. With this development came a new importance of foreign policy, which impacted the political sphere with emerging opinions and the weight of the impact. Key insight for political impact from industrialization in this period, especially for England, comes from Karl Marx. Marx represents one opinion towards the Industrial Revolution that emerged further beyond the period, but is valuable when analyzing industrialization impact on politics.[^22] Marx believed industrialism increased the gap between the rich and poor, but paved the way for revolution and communism. He believed technological growth was paired with human liberation, and the progression of industrialization impacted society by showing the polarization between owners of production and workers. Industrial development also introduced different political perspectives about what to attribute different success to through the period along with the various mediums of growth emerging; “The result has been a failure to grasp the diversity of the experience of industrialization. There were many alternatives to mechanization in improved hand technology, the use of cheap labour-saving materials, the division of labour and the simplification of individual tasks, which were developed in their own right."[^23] The impact of new technology on military and economic development on politics continued past the period described as the Second Industrial Revolution, influencing the political and social climate in Europe.

Industrialization completely changed the way of production of goods and work life for Europeans. The transition for craftsmen into industrialized work was a difficult one; main points of challenges being changes in freedom in the workplace and workplace conditions.[^24] Industrialization impacted everyone in their lives in the workplace; children, women, and men all experienced poor conditions and a wave of new ways of producing goods using the new technologies. Industrialization, specifically in the earlier part of the era, fostered an environment of cost-focus and danger accepting conditions. Child labor was normalized, as cheap labor with room for education and growth within specific industries. In the 1850s, factories became more sophisticated and required minimal education for children in the workforce. Child labor was an issue faced in industrialization beyond this period. Industrialization and the development workplace of mass production impacted family dynamics and societal structures. In a diary on conditions in the workplace, Engels described that “When every member of the family works, the individual worker can get on with proportionately less, and the bourgeoisie has made the most of the opportunity of employing and making profitable the labor of women and children afforded by machine-work”, which explains why families were economically inclined to child labor.[^25] Child labor began as a focus on tangible food production, but developed into networking and socializing within labor markets for the industrial market. Industrialization in the workplace created a new prominence of economic values in the purpose of everyday lives and in families. Britain focused on maximizing production and transportation, working on their exporting goods and boosting their economy. Economic purpose became dominant in society and politics, through the integration of machinery rather than hand crafting, factory production rather than production within families, and the increased pool of laborers.

Industrialization not only impacted political, military, and social to a national scale, but also impacted day to day lives through the increase of consumerism in the industrialization period. The increase in mass production and mass consumerism led to a broader divide in society. The divide between consumers and producers became more polarized through this period, one key factor being the development of the automobile and the exclusiveness of ownership of an automobile. The introduction of new technologies also created a dependence on technology, reducing the need for human labor in some industries and leading to unemployment for some in the workforce. This created an even further economic divide, and with the increase in wealth disparity, further societal divide followed. Whether it was unemployment or employment in poor working conditions, social polarization was a direct result of economic influence from industrialization. The automobile was not an accessible technology and the exclusiveness of emerging technologies contributed to the divide. This divide also separated classes politically; According to “Poverty, Politics and Development: Western Europe in First Half of 19th Century and South Asia in Second Half of the 20th”, the political and social divide interwoven by industrialization promoted revolution, including the revolution in 1848.[^26] The day to day basis was impacted by the reliance on mass production and mass consumption rather than family providing for the family. The family dynamic was a major factor affected by industrialization. Child labor, women in factories, and workplace conditions were common issues faced during this period and only added to the divide between social classes. The social divides caused by the industry markets impacted political divides and uprising in the mid 19th century.
