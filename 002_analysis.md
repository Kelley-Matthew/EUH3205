# Analysis

  In 1888, Kodak cameras went on sale with film rolls. People could now take their own photos without relying on a photographer, a tripod or complicated developing processes. People could just take the photos and send the film back to the Kodak factory for developing. 
	The invention and improvement of photography is important because it marks the beginning of photographic history. We can track people, events, inventions, places and artifacts though actual images of them, instead of relying on second hand accounts of them. This technology also developed into what we have now- digital cameras in virtually everyone’s pockets.

  The car, named the Patent-Motorwagen, took its maiden voyage on July 3, 1886 on the Ringstrasse, a small stretch of road in Mannheim, Germany. However, it was in 1888, two years later, when the car gained fame. Bertha Benz, Karl’s wife, drove the car from Mannheim to Pforzheim, about 66 miles, showing the car’s practical use over long distances. In the following year, it was shown at the 1889 Paris Exposition. 25 Patent-Motorwagens were created from 1886-1894.
  From here, the industry grew, and automobiles were seen in both Europe and America at the turn of the century. Karl Benz merged his company with Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach, creating the Daimler-Benz company. This is now known today as the Mercedes Benz car brand. Ransom E. Olds founded the company Oldsmobile, and produced thousands of cars through the use of the assembly line in the early 20th century.  
The invention of automobiles is significant because it allowed people and products to travel further, faster, and more efficiently. This ushered in a shift from horse-drawn carriages to machine powered transportation across Europe and the United States.

  In 1859, a large-scale sewage system began construction in England. Joseph Bazalgette, a long time advocate for a comprehensive sewer system designed the underground system. These pipes drew the waste away from the city, and dumped it into the Thames where it could be taken out to the sea. This lowered infectious diseases, health hazards, and the smell.
  This is significant because it marked a new interest in public health, sanitation, and hygiene. The government took responsibility for the public health of the people by recognizing the problem, passing legislation to address it, and engineering a solution. This interest is reflected in the reduced rates of cholera, bacterial diseases and waterborne pathogens compared to earlier times.
