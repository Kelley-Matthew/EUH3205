In 1888, Kodak cameras went on sale with film rolls. People could now take their own photos without relying on a photographer, a tripod or complicated developing processes. People could just take the photos and send the film back to the Kodak factory for developing. 
The invention and improvement of photography is important because it marks the beginning of photographic history. We can track people, events, inventions, places and artifacts though actual images of them, instead of relying on second hand accounts of them. This technology also developed into what we have now- digital cameras in virtually everyone’s pockets.

The car, named the Patent-Motorwagen, took its maiden voyage on July 3, 1886 on the Ringstrasse, a small stretch of road in Mannheim, Germany. However, it was in 1888, two years later, when the car gained fame. Bertha Benz, Karl’s wife, drove the car from Mannheim to Pforzheim, about 66 miles, showing the car’s practical use over long distances. In the following year, it was shown at the 1889 Paris Exposition. 25 Patent-Motorwagens were created from 1886-1894.
From here, the industry grew, and automobiles were seen in both Europe and America at the turn of the century. Karl Benz merged his company with Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach, creating the Daimler-Benz company. This is now known today as the Mercedes Benz car brand. Ransom E. Olds founded the company Oldsmobile, and produced thousands of cars through the use of the assembly line in the early 20th century.  
The invention of automobiles is significant because it allowed people and products to travel further, faster, and more efficiently. This ushered in a shift from horse-drawn carriages to machine powered transportation across Europe and the United States.

  In 1859, a large-scale sewage system began construction in England. Joseph Bazalgette, a long time advocate for a comprehensive sewer system designed the underground system. These pipes drew the waste away from the city, and dumped it into the Thames where it could be taken out to the sea. This lowered infectious diseases, health hazards, and the smell.
  This is significant because it marked a new interest in public health, sanitation, and hygiene. The government took responsibility for the public health of the people by recognizing the problem, passing legislation to address it, and engineering a solution. This interest is reflected in the reduced rates of cholera, bacterial diseases and waterborne pathogens compared to earlier times.

In Germany, the length of railroad tracks quadrupled between 1850 and 1873. By 1870, railways had become Germany's largest employer, with the workforce growing tenfold in the span of two decades. Indicators of this growth were evident: the permanent German railway labor force rose from 26,084 workers in 1850 to 234,114 by 1870, while the Prussian net domestic product surged from 28.9 to 365.5 during the same period (German Historical Institute, "Railway Statistics for the German Reich, 1835-1884"). The development of railroads was a catalyst for urbanization because it provided efficient transportation of goods and people, which in turn stimulated commerce, industrial production, and population growth. Rural workers, attracted by the promise of steady work and better living conditions, moved closer to industrial hubs, allowing cities like Berlin, Leipzig, and Hamburg to experience significant urbanization. Already a political and cultural center, Berlin grew into a central industrial point as railways connected it to raw materials, markets, and labor.

Breakthroughs in chemical manufacturing, including the creation of synthetic dyes, fertilizers, and explosives, had profound social and demographic consequences. German chemist Justus von Liebig laid the groundwork for understanding soil nutrients in the mid-19th century, and the later advancements made by Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch in 1909 with the synthesis of ammonia were crucial in revolutionizing European agricultural practices. Liebig’s work established the foundation for using nitrates and phosphates, which significantly boosted soil fertility, while Haber and Bosch’s synthesis of ammonia enabled the mass production of nitrogen-based fertilizers. For instance, the discovery and import of Peruvian guano in England and later synthetic nitrogen fertilizers alleviated food shortages, helping to sustain growing urban populations in rapidly industrializing cities like Berlin and Hamburg. The expansion of Germany’s chemical industry created a higher demand for factory labor, particularly in cities like Ludwigshafen, where BASF, one of the world's largest chemical companies, was founded.

Furthermore, technological advancements in agriculture, such as mechanized farming equipment and improved crop rotation methods, enhanced food production and allowed for larger, more efficient farms. European nations produced more food with less labor, thus supporting larger populations and accelerating urbanization by pushing rural workers to seek employment in growing industrial centers. These workers now gravitated towards industrial hubs like Manchester and Birmingham in Britain, Berlin in Germany, and Lyon in France, contributing to the rapid urbanization and factory workforce in those cities.
The agricultural surplus produced during this period helped stabilize food supplies in cities, supporting population growth and reducing the frequency of famines. Notably, the more prevalent usage of chemical fertilizers significantly influenced agricultural productivity in 19th-century Europe. Farmers increasingly relied on nitrates, potassium, and phosphates produced by the booming chemical industries in countries like Germany and Britain. These fertilizers were vital to maintaining nutrients in the soil, thus enabling higher crop yields and more reliable harvests. However, beyond the agricultural sector, technological progress in the steel industry also became advantageous for food supplies. Mechanized steel farming equipment, such as plows and reapers, allowed farmers to cultivate larger areas and harvest crops more efficiently, thus enhancing agricultural productivity, reducing the reliance on manual labor, and supporting growing urban populations.
